iii) Buttons in view/edit page should be square button.

v) After save as copy it should redirect to listing jd page(show relevant data).
vi) user profile image should not be distorted in mobile view.
vii) dmi logo should be left alligned in mobile view also.
viii) Cancel and back button in view/edit jd should be allign center.
